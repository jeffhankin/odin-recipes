    <h1>Bread Pudding</h1>
    <img src="./breadpudding.jpg">
    <p>My family loves bread pudding so when I make this recipe, I double it and bake it in a 9x13-inch dish. Made with basic pantry ingredients and some day-old bread (try a rich egg bread or a moist white loaf), this easy recipe can be served for breakfast or dessert with milk poured over top or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>
    <p>The best bread for bread pudding is a slightly stale loaf that would otherwise go to waste. Of course, some breads are better suited for bread pudding than others.  Opt for a hearty and sturdy loaf that can stand up to the rich custard without falling apart. Challah, brioche, sourdough, or French bread are all fantastic choices. Basically, any bread that would work well for French toast will also work well for bread pudding.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices day-old bread, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bread pieces into an 8-inch square baking pan. Drizzle melted butter over bread and sprinkle raisins over top.</li>
        <li>Whisk milk, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla together in a medium mixing bowl until well combined. Pour mixture over bread, and lightly push down with a fork until all bread is covered and soaking up the liquid.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
